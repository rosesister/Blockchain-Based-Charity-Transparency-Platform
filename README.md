# 🌍 Blockchain-Based Charity Transparency Platform

Welcome to a decentralized platform built on the Stacks blockchain to enhance trust in charitable giving! This project uses Clarity smart contracts to provide transparent, immutable scores for charities based on their financials, operations, and impact, empowering donors to make informed decisions.

## ✨ Features

🔍 **Transparency Scores**: Charities receive scores based on financial transparency, efficiency, and measurable impact.  
💸 **Donor Confidence**: Donors can verify charity data and scores on-chain before contributing.  
📊 **Immutable Records**: Financial reports and impact metrics are stored on the blockchain for trust and auditability.  
🏆 **Reputation System**: Charities earn reputation tokens for consistent transparency, boosting donor trust.  
🔐 **Secure Voting**: Donors and auditors can vote on charity performance, with results aggregated on-chain.  
🌐 **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven updates to scoring criteria via governance contracts.  
✅ **Verification Process**: Independent auditors can submit verified charity data to ensure accuracy.  

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Charities
1. **Register**: Charities register their organization on the platform using the `CharityRegistry` contract.
2. **Submit Data**: Submit financial reports, operational data, and impact metrics via the `DataSubmission` contract.
3. **Get Scored**: The `ScoringEngine` contract calculates a transparency score based on predefined criteria.
4. **Earn Reputation**: High scores and consistent reporting earn reputation tokens via the `ReputationManager` contract.
5. **Update Data**: Charities can update their data periodically, triggering a re-evaluation of their score.

### For Donors
1. **Browse Charities**: Use the `CharityRegistry` contract to view registered charities and their transparency scores.
2. **Verify Data**: Access immutable financial and impact data through the `DataStorage` contract.
3. **Vote**: Donors can vote on charity performance using the `VotingSystem` contract to influence scores.
4. **Donate**: Make informed donation decisions based on transparent, on-chain data.

### For Auditors
1. **Submit Verifications**: Independent auditors submit verified charity data via the `AuditorVerification` contract.
2. **Earn Rewards**: Auditors receive tokens for accurate verifications, incentivizing integrity.

### For Governance
1. **Propose Changes**: Community members propose updates to scoring criteria using the `Governance` contract.
2. **Vote on Proposals**: Token holders vote to approve or reject changes, ensuring decentralized control.

## 📜 Smart Contracts

This project uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to power the platform:

1. **CharityRegistry**: Manages charity registration and basic metadata (name, mission, contact).
2. **DataSubmission**: Handles submission of financial reports, operational data, and impact metrics.
3. **DataStorage**: Stores charity data immutably with timestamps and version control.
4. **ScoringEngine**: Calculates transparency scores based on submitted data and predefined criteria.
5. **ReputationManager**: Issues reputation tokens to charities based on consistent transparency.
6. **VotingSystem**: Enables donors and auditors to vote on charity performance, influencing scores.
7. **AuditorVerification**: Allows auditors to submit verified data and earn rewards.
8. **Governance**: Facilitates community-driven updates to scoring criteria and platform rules.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain wallet (e.g., Hiro Wallet)
- Clarity development environment (e.g., Clarinet)
- Basic understanding of Clarity smart contracts

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/charity-transparency-platform.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies and set up Clarinet:
   ```bash
   cd charity-transparency-platform
   clarinet install
   ```
3. Deploy contracts to the Stacks testnet:
   ```bash
   clarinet deploy
   ```

### Usage
- **Charities**: Register using the `CharityRegistry` contract and submit data via `DataSubmission`.
- **Donors**: Query charity details and scores using `CharityRegistry` and `DataStorage`.
- **Auditors**: Submit verified data through `AuditorVerification`.
- **Community**: Propose and vote on changes via the `Governance` contract.

## 🌟 Why This Matters

Lack of transparency in charitable organizations often leads to donor skepticism and reduced giving. This platform solves this by:
- Providing verifiable, immutable data on charity performance.
- Incentivizing charities to maintain transparency through reputation tokens.
- Empowering donors with clear, trustworthy information.
- Enabling community governance for fairness and adaptability.

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- Integration with off-chain data oracles for real-time financial data.
- Mobile app for easy donor access to charity scores.
- Multi-chain support for broader adoption.
